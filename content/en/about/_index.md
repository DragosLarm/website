DragosLarm has existed as a product in Sweden since the mid-1990s and was previously marketed through Elektometer AB before DragosLarm AB was founded as an independent company in 2008 to focus solely on uncomplicated and reliable surveillance solutions for critical ventilation.

In 2023, DragosLarm was acquired by Johan Theselius and the Jetlab companies as owner-managed well-known and brand-independent service and consulting companies with a focus on basic equipment for laboratories.

Today, Dragos alarms have many satisfied customers at our primary and secondary schools, universities, colleges, hospitals, industrial labs, pharmaceutical companies and in other places where laboratories are located. Dragos is also used at facilities outside Sweden.
