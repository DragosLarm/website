As early as 1998, a German journal reported on the need to regularly check fume hoods as safety equipment. Monitoring the operation of parts of the ventilation system (e.g. monitoring the fan speed) is generally not sufficient.

The following example was given:

**Perchloric acid** had been used for years on a perchloric acid fume extractor. During an inspection of the roof of the building, the fan blades of the extractor were found on the roof: completely corroded and lying in front of the opening of the exhaust air duct!

Only the shaft still driven by the motor was rotating in the pipe. However, the effectiveness of this extractor was practically non-existent, with only a weak air exchange presumably still taking place due to convection. The really worrying thing about this case is that none of the users had noticed anything.

DragosLarm monitors precisely this scenario for you, because DragosLarm monitors the air flow and gives an acoustic and visual signal as soon as it drops. Simple, safe and reliable.
