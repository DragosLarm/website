Dragos ELF 2012R24V

If there is a deviation from the preset alarm limit in the event of malfunctions in the protective ventilation or in the event of a total failure of the ventilation, the visual and acoustic alarm is triggered after a certain delay (adjustable 0-60 seconds).

After another approximately 30 seconds, the electrical locking is triggered, i.e. the cabinet lighting and the connected contacts are de-energized except for the alarm and another existing contact, e.g. B. Stirrer,.

The power is reset manually via a push button on the front. The function is blocked until the ventilation returns to normal.
